    <h1 e>PROJECT PROPOSAL</h1><br>
    <hr>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>For my project I want to create a narrative hypertext that adapts the composition and themes of Hieronymus Bosch’s triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights. My project, Digital Delights, will be a web interface that allows users to explore a virtual composition full of text, images, sounds, forms and other expressive HTML elements that involve the viewer in the turbulent and wonderfully complex composition of The Garden of Earthly Delights. This digital garden will intentionally make use of the web as a medium to interrogate our understanding of pleasure and consumption, crime and punishment, and imagined futures of humanity. User participation will be central for the construction of this world, visitors will be encouraged to talk about their desires and fears, give personal confessions, act on their curiosities, and participate in forums, comment sections, polls, and questionnaires. The result of my final project will hopefully showcase the fears and desires that currently dominate digital (and actual) culture—telling the user a story about the current moral values influencing society.
    </p>
    <p>
      While researching for this project, and exploring the web in general, I found myself drawn to early net art that uses simple HTML elements to involve the user in interactive and evocative narratives. As an artist I have to carefully consider the medium I choose to make a piece; always asking myself what is this material saying about this piece? For that reason I've grown an appreciation for early net artists like Oilia Lialina and Martine Neddam, who I will discuss more under my artist research section, because their medium of choice—hypertext—helps in supporting a piece the same way as brushstrokes on a canvas helps to tell a story about the art process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeling frustrated by the division between my love for the fine arts and my current academic path in computation arts, I knew my project should somehow aid in that disconnect. I decided to enroll in a painting class this semester to ease that frustration, and get my hands dirty at least once a week. For this class I had to visit the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and draw a painting. I chose to draw a Dutch painting from 1665, “Interior with a Woman at the Virginals” by Emanuel de Witte. While attempting to replicate its composition, I realized de Witte was using rectangles to tell me a story. The composition is extremely organized and geometric, rectangles are used to frame certain elements and guide the viewer's eye. The focal point is a maid towards which all the diagonals of the painting go. The way the composition is organized reminded me of internet artist Olia Lialina’s use of multiple browser frames in My Boyfriend Came Back from the War, a hypertext fiction in which “the user advances the story by clicking on hyperlinked, fragmentary phrases and images. With each click, the browser viewport subdivides into smaller and smaller frames.” (Rhizome). The connection between these two artworks inspired my idea to create a webpage that allows users to virtually navigate through the narrative of a painting. The goal is not to replicate the visual properties of a painting, but rather to use the structure of a painting to retrace the themes and stories threaded throughout its composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this I needed a painting who’s composition and themes were more than just suitable for a digital reformatting; its adaptation had to make room for the production of something new. My criteria for picking a suitable image is as follows: a composition with multiple frames or sections, interesting and explorable imagery that can function as a map for me to design the narrative path, interesting subject matter or themes that feel relevant today, and themes that could benefit or feel enhanced by a digital medium. I found that The Garden of Earthly Delights would be perfect for these reasons. The composition has multiple frames, while the imagery is complex and bizarre. It is a visual narrative, the central panel depicts a world full of fleshy indulgence and sexual pleasure that consequently leads humanity directly to eternal damnation in hell in the left panel. The main subject matter, sexuality and lust, represents the fears that once dominated life and tells us a story about morals and sin during that particular time—the painting however is timeless. In the following section I will closely examine the painting’s structure and themes, and how these will be translated in my project.

    <h2>PAINTING STRUCTURE</h2>
    <p>
      The Garden of Earthly Delights is a triptych consisting of three oak panels, hinged together so that the outer panels can be closed. When the panels are closed we can see an image on the outside depicting the third biblical day. The outside image is gloomy, painted with a green-gray grisaille, a dramatic contrast to the colorful interior. My project will begin with a similarly monochrome homepage that the user must ‘open’ to navigate the rest of the contents. Once the panels are opened the viewer is faced with a scene that is chaotic and overwhelming—sort of like the internet—however, its composition is very intentional. At the time when this was painted, between 1490 and 1510, triptychs usually featured one prominent biblical scene in the center, with church donors or saints on the sides. In The Garden of Earthly Delights, all three panels are equally part of the story. My project will adopt a similar format; having at least three sections or chapters that all connect through hyperlinks. My project’s interface might feel unintuitive or unorthodox, because I plan to deviate from typical web design that we are used to seeing on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had ever seen anything quite The Garden of Earthly Delights—it must have been a real sensation for its initial audience. It was a new and exciting spectacle, like an early form of cinema that could occupy viewers for hours. The presentation and composition was avante-garde, therefore a digital adaptation could be successful in replicating a similar reaction for newer online viewers. It’s possible that the work was intended to be a conversation piece; figures inside the painting are frequently seen pointing and whispering secrets to each other, reflecting the viewers doing the same thing outside of the painting. For this reason, a feature I want to include in my project is synchronous conferencing. Scattered throughout the landscape will be online chat rooms or comment sections for the user to engage with other people, or discover the remains of past conversations, or simply to shout into the void.

    <h2>NARRATIVE THEMES</h2>
    <p>
      Interpretations of Bosch's intent range from an admonishment against fleshy pleasure, the consequences of temptations, to Bosch’s personal erotic fantasy, or just a medieval acid trip. Our contemporary sensibilities often distort our view of The Garden of Earthly Delight, for while we may be comfortable with sex and nudity, in the middle ages and renaissance era, sex was seen as conducive to humanity’s fall from grace. Furthermore, Bosch’s imagery may feel otherworldly and impossibly surreal for its time, however this was painted at a time when artists and writers were actively reconstructing and creating new, uniquely terrifying visions of Hell. Bosch also had access to archives and libraries where he likely found inspiration in the form of  humorous or sexual drolleries in the margins of manuscripts. So while The Garden of Earthly Delights was still unorthodox, it was a much more faithful representation of the world Bosch lived in then one might think. My project will use imagery that is provocative but not totally unfamiliar. Like Bosch and the drolleries, I will likely source images from different corners of the internet and intentionally include culturally significant or recognizable media. Because my goal is not to reproduce a digital copy of the painting, I plan to modernize certain aspects so that the viewer can sense the relationship between this digital garden, and their own real life experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, The Garden of Earthly Delight is intensely moralistic and should be recognized  for what it is, religious propaganda. The painting is about sin, and its dominant subject is pleasure. The left panel depicts the moment God presents Eve to Adam, who begins experiencing sexual arousal for the first time. The center panel shows an explosion of figures experiencing sensory pleasures in their pre-moral existence; a life without consequence. I’d argue that cyberspace would be a great place to host such a garden, and in a way already is. The internet is a space where many go to act on their curiosity overtly and without shame, for better or worse. I want my project to feel like a playground of corruption, showcasing the sensationally gut-wrenching World Wide Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I should note that I do not want to create christian propaganda. My project will only use religion as a whole to ask the user questions about morals, consequences, justice, and death, but will avoid making any direct stance on the matters (this is left for the users). The right panel depicts a hellish world of people reaping eternal damnation, punished for succumbing to life’s temptations. Here the nudity of the figures has lost all its eroticism and becomes rather disturbing. Bosch describes hell not as an unimaginable or impossible place, but as a realistically disturbing man-made world. It would be incredibly difficult and likely traumatizing to recreate a contemporary version of Bosch’s hell. There is already so much horror on the internet, it would take a lifetime to sort through and compile it all. Instead of doing this, I will again leave it up to user submissions to construct hell, thus focusing on the sentiment that hell is man-made. This will look like the user playing the role of the judge and jury. There are a few ways I may do this;
      while exploring the user may get a pop-up image of a person, and are asked to ‘choose my punishment!’ Once their answer is submitted the user can scroll through previous submissions. Expanding on that same format, there could be a 50% chance the user will be presented with an image of a man or a woman. The varying severity of punishments will showcase user biases regarding accountability and punishment.

    <h2>ARTIST RESEARCH</h2>
    <p>
      I previously mentioned Olia Lialina’s artwork My Boyfriend Came Back from the War as inspiration for my project. This artwork, which was created in 1996, is an example of early net art and interactive hypertext fiction. The webpage consists of multiple browser frames displaying black and white bit-map images. As the clicks through hyperlinked, fragmented phrases and images, the frame subdivides into smaller and smaller frames, revealing a nonlinear and personal story about a couple. The story unfolds to the point where the screen has become a mosaic of empty black frames. Olia Lialina’s interest in cinema influenced her art, she called the piece a “netfilm” because of its filmic qualities. The artwork was create at a time when the web was still new;“the medium of the web promised connection, but the story the work tells is one of estrangement, of the impossibility of relationships under conditions of geopolitical conflict” (2016). The piece is recognized as a key work of 1990s artistic practice and use of HTML on the early web.
    </p>
    <p>
      My project is similar in a few ways. Whereas Lialina is adapting cinematic montage to the web, I am collaging; I am using her model of joining multiple frames together through HTML code and an internet browser. I might model my project’s interface after My Boyfriend Came Back from the War, as the use of multiple frames would suit the themes and composition of my project, and the subdividing into smaller and smaller frames makes for interesting and engaging storytelling. However, this would just be a starting point for the structuring of my project. My project requires multiple types of interaction, and will incorporate more than clicking and clicking and more clicking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start of this proposal I mentioned I felt drawn to early net art. What I meant was that there is a particular website created in 1996 that I became immediately obsessed with after encountering for the first time. Mouchette.org tells the story of a french teenager, nearly 13 years old. Mouchette is a virtual persona with many many fans, she is an artist and a poet, she lives with her parents in Amsterdam, is interested in suicide and strangers, and was created by artist Martine Neddam. The still expanding website uses expressive HTML elements to involve the viewer in the turbulent emotional world of an adolescent girl (Rhizome). Partially based on the film Mouchette, the storyline tis filled with themes of sex and death. For example, there is a section named "***digital flesh&blood***" displaying a close-up image of a young girl with her tongue out, seemingly licking the inside of your computer screen. The text says "want to know what my tongue tastes like? Try it on your screen and tell me." User participation was an important element of the project, taking contributions from users to form Mouchette's identity. Neddam created a complimentary website in 2003, Mouchette.net, where users could claim Mouchette’s identity and alter her personal website. Mouchette now stands as a “singular and important archive of online culture—humorous, dark, and often surprisingly touching” (Rhizome).

      Cameron’s World, a web-collage assembled by Cameron Askin with javascript by Anthony Hughes and music by Robin Hughes, is A love letter to the Internet of old. The hectic but structured collage is a carnival of the obsolesced, exploding with over 700 clipart and animated GIFs that could once be found on GeoCities, a web-hosting service that allowed people to build their own sites. These personal websites were often a form of self-expression, or a way to share niche interests and participate with online communities. Each page could evoke some specific ambience that reflected the interests or personality of its creator. In that way, it was a predecessor of later social networking sites like Myspace and Facebook. Cameron’s World feels like a portal into the weirdest and most personalized corners of the old-school World Wide Web, capturing the intimacy and playfulness that was left behind in the 90s. While Cameron’s World captures something beyond the kitschy aesthetics of 90’s website design, it also captures a certain mindset. Cyberspace used to be a destination, a website was thought of as an  actual ‘site’ that the user was actively visiting, and the homepage was really a second home, decorated with email buttons, welcome signs, and navigation menus. There was more of a spatial sense, a feeling that one was navigating throughout a real place. Cameron’s World captures this feeling by taking the user on a linear journey, as the user scrolls down the page the environment will dramatically change as if you have moved into a new location. The landing page is space-themed and filled with UFO GIFs, spinning planets, and a star background. Scrolling through the website, the user will travel through a fantasy realm, a water section for fish, a hyperlink forest, and various other sections to eventually reach the end of the page, hell. Once you’ve reached the bottom, there is a real sense that you have traveled and descended through an entire world.
