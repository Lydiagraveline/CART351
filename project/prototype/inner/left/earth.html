          The 6th day when God created Adam and Eve, humans are still free from
          sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eve has just been created from one of Adam’s ribs. In between them
          stands God, dressed in pink,supervizing Adam and Eve in the earthly
          realm. He blesses the new couple and gives them the following
          injunction: ‘Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and govern it’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take heed, says the Lord. And he holds Eve's hand, already knowing
          what will come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below Eve’s feet, rabbits are scurrying past, symbolising fertility.
          In the days of Bosch, this quote from the Bible was interpreted as the
          institution of marriage. Medieval man saw marriage and reproduction as
          being inextricably linked: sexual intercourse was intended only as a
          means to reproduce, not as an act of lust or desire.

      <p>
        Directly beneath them, we see a scene of strange animals, depicted as
        the divine interacting with with the material world in more complex and
        disturbing ways.

        Birds (divine agents) struggle to keep the vermin at bay, like the 3
        headed bird representing the holy trinity. And the cat who has killed a
        vermin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the birds succumb to corruption, assuming the characteristics of
        the lower level as they battle it

      <p>The lower level itself is represented by the pond--an idicator for the conscious and subconscious mind of man. </p>
      <p>Exposed to the mind of man (what can't we ruin, you might ask?) the mighty unicorn, too, proves to be capable of corruption. </p>

      <p>
        In the wall of the pond, there is a cavity directly connecting the water to the cave.
